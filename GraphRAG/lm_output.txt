Query: What are the main papers about Graph Neural Networks in recommender systems?

Based on the provided context, the main papers about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recommender systems are:

1.  **"Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective"** by Andreas Peintner. This paper outlines research into novel graph-based methods for sequential recommendation. It positions graph-based modeling of sequences as a state-of-the-art approach that introduces a structured, inductive bias into the learning framework, alongside transformer-based architectures.

2.  **"Recommendation Based on Graph Neural Network with Structural Identity"** by Wentao Bai and Congying Guo. This work addresses a limitation of standard GNNs in recommendation, which is their focus on local "community information" and their inability to capture the global "structural identity" or roles of nodes. The authors propose a model called SIGNN that captures both types of information to improve recommendation performance.

3.  **"Graph Trend Filtering Networks for Recommendation"** by a team including Jiliang Tang, Wenqi Fan, and others. This paper identifies drawbacks in existing GNN-based recommender systems, such as their non-robustness to unreliable user interactions (e.g., random clicks). To address this, the authors propose the Graph Trend Filtering Networks (GTN), a method designed to capture the adaptive reliability of interactions within the graph.

These three papers represent key research directions: applying GNNs to sequential recommendation, enhancing them with structural identity awareness, and making them more robust through graph trend filtering.

The primary papers are:

1.  **"Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective"** by Andreas Peintner. This paper outlines research into using graph-based modeling for sequential recommendation.
