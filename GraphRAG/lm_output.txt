Query: What are the main papers about Graph Neural Networks in recommender systems?

Based on the provided context, the main papers about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recommender systems are:

1.  **"Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective"** by Andreas Peintner. This paper outlines research into novel graph-based methods for sequential recommendation. It positions graph-based modeling of sequences as a state-of-the-art approach that introduces a structured, inductive bias into the learning framework, alongside transformer-based architectures.

2.  **"Recommendation Based on Graph Neural Network with Structural Identity"** by Wentao Bai and Congying Guo. This work addresses a limitation of standard GNNs in recommendation, which is their focus on local "community information" and their inability to capture the global "structural identity" or roles of nodes. The authors propose a model called SIGNN that captures both types of information to improve recommendation performance.

3.  **"Graph Trend Filtering Networks for Recommendation"** by a team including Jiliang Tang, Wenqi Fan, and others. This paper identifies drawbacks in existing GNN-based recommender systems, such as their non-robustness to unreliable user interactions (e.g., random clicks). To address this, the authors propose the Graph Trend Filtering Networks (GTN), a method designed to capture the adaptive reliability of interactions within the graph.

These three papers represent key research directions: applying GNNs to sequential recommendation, enhancing them with structural identity awareness, and making them more robust through graph trend filtering.

Query: What are the main papers about Graph Neural Networks in recommender systems?

Based on the provided context, the main papers about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recommender systems are those that propose novel GNN-based models to address specific limitations in the field.

The primary papers identified are:

1.  **"Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective"** by Andreas Peintner. This paper outlines research into using graph-based modeling for sequential recommendation. It argues that introducing a graph structure to model sequences provides a beneficial inductive bias, positioning graph-based approaches as state-of-the-art alongside transformer-based models for predicting a user's next interaction.

2.  **"Recommendation Based on Graph Neural Network with Structural Identity"** by Wentao Bai and Congying Guo. This paper identifies a key limitation in standard GNNs for recommendation: their inability to capture a node's structural identity (its role in the graph), as they primarily capture local community information from neighbors. To solve this, the authors propose SIGNN, a Structural-Identity-aware Graph Neural Network designed to capture both types of information for improved performance.

3.  **"Graph Trend Filtering Networks for Recommendation"** by a team including Jiliang Tang, Wenqi Fan, and others. This paper addresses the drawback that most GNN-based recommender systems treat all user-item interactions as equally reliable, overlooking noise from unreliable behaviors like random clicks. The proposed solution is GTN (Graph Trend Filtering Networks), a framework that introduces graph trend collaborative filtering to adaptively capture the reliability of interactions, aiming for more robust and stable performance.

Furthermore, the context reveals that these papers build upon influential prior work, as evidenced by their citations. Key co-cited papers that form a foundational background for GNNs in recommendation include "Neural Collaborative Filtering," "Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering," and "KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation."

Query: What are the main papers about Graph Neural Networks in recommender systems?

Based on the provided context, the main papers about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recommender systems are the three retrieved papers, each addressing a distinct challenge or aspect of GNN-based recommendation.

1.  **"Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective"** by Andreas Peintner (and potentially collaborators like Eva Zangerle, based on the influential co-authors list). This paper focuses on sequential recommender systems, which predict a user's next action. It positions graph-based modeling of sequences as a state-of-the-art approach that introduces a beneficial structured, inductive bias into the learning framework, alongside transformer-based architectures.

2.  **"Recommendation Based on Graph Neural Network with Structural Identity"** by Wentao Bai and Congying Guo. This work identifies a key limitation in standard GNNs for recommendation: their inability to capture a node's "structural identity" (its role in the graph) beyond local "community information." To solve this, the authors propose SIGNN, a Structural-Identity-aware Graph Neural Network designed to capture both types of information for improved performance.

3.  **"Graph Trend Filtering Networks for Recommendation"** by a large author team including Jiliang Tang, Wenqi Fan, and others. This paper addresses the issue of non-robustness in GNN-based recommenders caused by treating all user-item interactions (including unreliable ones like random clicks) uniformly. The authors propose the Graph Trend Filtering Network (GTN), a method that captures the adaptive reliability of interactions to achieve more stable and optimal performance.

Furthermore, the citation context reveals that **"Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering"** and **"KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation"** are highly influential key papers, as they are co-cited by multiple seed papers in this research area.

Query: What are the main papers about Graph Neural Networks in recommender systems?

Based on the provided context, the main papers about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recommender systems are those that propose specific GNN-based models to address limitations in recommendation tasks. Here is a synthesized overview:

1.  **"Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective"** by Andreas Peintner: This paper outlines research into novel graph-based methods for sequential recommendation. It positions graph-based modeling of user-item interaction sequences as a state-of-the-art approach that introduces a beneficial structured, inductive bias into the learning framework, often in combination with transformer architectures.

2.  **"Recommendation Based on Graph Neural Network with Structural Identity"** by Wentao Bai and Congying Guo: This paper directly addresses a key limitation of standard GNNs in recommendation. The authors argue that typical GNNs only capture local "community information" from a node's neighbors and fail to capture a node's "structural identity" (its role in the graph). To solve this, they propose a model called SIGNN, which is designed to capture both types of information to improve recommendation performance.

3.  **"Graph Trend Filtering Networks for Recommendation"** by a team including Jiliang Tang, Wenqi Fan, and others: This paper identifies another limitation in GNN-based recommender systems: their non-robustness to unreliable user interactions (e.g., random clicks). The authors propose the Graph Trend Filtering Networks (GTN) framework, which introduces a graph trend collaborative filtering method to adaptively capture the reliability of interactions, thereby leading to more stable and optimal performance.

Furthermore, the context indicates that these contemporary GNN-based recommendation models build upon influential foundational work. Specifically, the papers "Neural Collaborative Filtering" and "Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering" are co-cited as key references by multiple papers in this set, highlighting their importance in the field.
